<p>Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar power to generate electricity, solar thermal energy (including solar water heating), and 
    solar architecture.[1][2] 
    It is an essential source of renewable energy, 
    and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or a
    ctive solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or
     convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power, and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. </p>
